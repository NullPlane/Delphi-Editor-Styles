# Color styles for Delphi Editor.
Random collection of my self-mixed graphical styles I use in RAD Studio's Code Editor. Is made for fast copying, as setting it manually or transferring is exhaustingly annoying.

I wanted to call em somewhat, so I gave them names.  
Please remember, that these are `extracted from BDS 22.0.` If they do not work, you may have to _**replace all the version numbers**_ in the regkeys. :)
